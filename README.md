# Deadlock-Preventon-and-RecoveryToolkit
Deadlock Prevention and Recovery Toolkit

The Deadlock Prevention and Recovery Toolkit is a lightweight, educational, and practical solution designed to help developers, students, and system designers understand and implement strategies for handling deadlocks in concurrent and distributed systems. Deadlocks are a common challenge in operating systems, database systems, and multi-threaded applications, where processes compete for shared resources. This toolkit provides a clear demonstration of how deadlocks occur and offers multiple techniques to detect, prevent, and recover from them.

This project focuses on simplifying complex concepts into well-structured modules. It includes implementations of essential algorithms such as Wait-Die, Wound-Wait, Banker’s Algorithm, Resource Allocation Graph (RAG) Detection, and Rollback/Abort Recovery Mechanisms. Each module is built to show how processes request resources and how the system responds based on the configured strategy.

The toolkit also simulates real-time scenarios where multiple processes run simultaneously and compete for resources. Users can visualize how the system behaves under various conditions—whether it blocks a process, grants a safe sequence, or detects a circular wait that may lead to a deadlock. The primary goal is to help learners understand the fundamentals of concurrency control, safe states, resource allocation, and recovery techniques.

The project offers detailed logs, process status tracking, and step-by-step explanations for each action performed by the system. These features make it ideal for academic projects, OS-related assignments, and practical demonstrations in classes or workshops. Whether you are studying operating systems or implementing concurrency logic in your applications, this toolkit provides a solid foundation.
